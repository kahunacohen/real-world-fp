# Functional Programming for Smarties

This post is aimed for intermediate JavaScript programmers, and/or those with very limited functional programming experience. I'll discuss what functional programming (fp) is, why to use it and how to integrate it into a real-world, existing code written in a procedural and/or object-oriented style.

We'll examine how a feature is typically developed using a procedural, object-oriented approach vs. a more functional approach. I'll use an example, that while somewhat forced, exemplifies the main principles of functional programming.

## What is Functional Programming?
With the popularity of frameworks such as [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) and [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) fp is has gotten lot of attention in the JavaScript community. But what is it and how can our programs benefit from it? Though fp has a reputation for being academic, it's main prinicples are simple to grasp and direct address recurrent challenges of programming in more traditional styles.

Fp is a way to solve larger problems by fitting together small, focused, *pure* functions, preferring immutable data structures over side-effects, stateful objects and mutable data. Functional solutions also tend to be more declarative rather than imperative. They read like a spec, rather than a list of instructions.

What does all this mean and why do we care? To make this more concrete, we'll implement a programming task in a typical object-oriented, procedural style, then transform it to a functional style.

## A Procedural Implementation
Ready? Let's go. Imagine data in a JSON file representing salary information for employees over a year:

```json
[
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "payments": [
      8333.33,
      8333.33,
      8333.33,
      8021.45,
      7023,
      9023.67,
      8333.33,
      8333.33,
      8333.33,
      6500,
      8333.33,
      8333.33
    ]
  },
  {
    "firstName": "Mary",
    "lastName": "Jane",
    "payments": [
      12083.33,
      12083.33,
      12083.33,
      11000,
      12102.24,
      12083.33,
      12083.33,
      12083.33,
      20076,
      12083.33,
      12083.33,
      12083.33
    ]
  }
]
```
We'd like to transform this data to a CSV file, where the total salary column is the sum of the monthly
payments. E.g.:

| Last Name  | First Name | Total Salary
| ---------- | -----------| ------------
| Doe        | John       |  97234.76
| Jane       | Mary       | 151928.21

Here's a typical impure, procedural, object-oriented approach. Granted in real-life we'd probably use a CSV parsing library,
but you get the drift. For now the class just writes a CSV file, but imagine while we evolve this code it does other things, including reading and writing internal state:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

class SalaryReporter {
  constructor(inPath, outPath) {
    // Ignore possible errors.
    this.data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(inPath, { encoding: "utf-8" }));
    this.outPath = outPath;
  }
  write() {
    // The first row of the return array are the headers

    let ret = [["Last Name", "First Name"]];

    // For each employee...
    for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
      const employee = this.data[i];
      let employeeTotal = 0;

      // Sum the yearly payments
      for (let j = 0; j < employee.pay.length; j++) {
        employeeTotal += employee.pay[j];
      }

      // Add a row with the employee's info, including total salary
      let row = [employee.lastName, employee.firstName, employeeTotal];
      ret.push(row);
    }
    fs.writeFileSync(this.outPath, ret.join("\n"), { encoding: "utf-8" });
  }
}
```

We could test the class like this:

```js
const fs = require("fs");


describe("Salary Reporter", () => {
  const outPath = `${__dirname}/employees.csv`;
  const safeDelete = () => {
    if (fs.existsSync(outPath)) {
      fs.unlinkSync(outPath);
    }
  };
  beforeEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  it("writes a correct CSV file", () => {
    const salaryReporter = new SalaryReporter(
      `${__dirname}/employees.json`,
      outPath
    );
    salaryReporter.write();
    expect(fs.readFileSync(outPath, { encoding: "utf-8" })).toEqual(
      "Last Name,First Name\nDoe,John,97234.76\nJane,Mary,151928.21"
    );
  });
});
```

Now imagine that in addition to a CSV file, we are asked to generate an HTML report. One approach might be to create a hierarchy of SalaryReporter classes, each one responsible for writing the report in a different way. Let's do that now. Here's a base class for both the CSV reporter and the HTML reporter:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

class SalaryReporter {
  constructor(inPath) {
    this.data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(inPath, { encoding: "utf-8" }));
    this.parsedData = [];
    this.parse();
  }
  parse() {
    // Only parse data if we haven't parsed it yet.
    if (this.parsedData.length === 0) {
      this.parsedData = [["Last Name", "First Name"]];
      for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
        const employee = this.data[i];
        let employeeTotal = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < employee.pay.length; j++) {
          employeeTotal += employee.pay[j];
        }
        let row = [employee.lastName, employee.firstName, employeeTotal];
        this.parsedData.push(row);
      }
    }
    return this;
  }
}
```

We've taken out the `write` method and added a `parse` method that's generally useful. `parse` saves the parsed data structure
as internal state (`this.parsedData`) and returns an instance of SalaryReporter. We could test it like this:

```js
describe("SalaryReporter", () => {
  it("parses correct 2 dim array", () => {
    const salaryReporter = new SalaryReporter(`${__dirname}/employees.json`);
    expect(salaryReporter.parsedData).toEqual([
      ["Last Name", "First Name"],
      ["Doe", "John", 97234.76],
      ["Jane", "Mary", 151928.21],
    ]);
  });
});
```

Now, let's subclass this base class to write a CSV report. The subclass cares only about it's specialization, writing
a CSV representation of the data:

```js
...
class SalaryCSVReporter extends SalaryReporter {
  write(outPath) {
    fs.writeFileSync(outPath, this.parsedData.join("\n"), {
      encoding: "utf-8",
    });
  }
}
```

...and it's test:

```js
...
describe("SalaryCSVReporter", () => {
  const outPath = `${__dirname}/employees.csv`;
  const safeDelete = () => {
    if (fs.existsSync(outPath)) {
      fs.unlinkSync(outPath);
    }
  };
  beforeEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  it("writes a CSV file", () => {
    const salaryCSVReporter = new SalaryCSVReporter(
      `${__dirname}/employees.json`
    );
    salaryCSVReporter.write(outPath);
    expect(true).toEqual(true);
    expect(fs.readFileSync(outPath, { encoding: "utf-8" })).toEqual(
      "Last Name,First Name\nDoe,John,97234.76\nJane,Mary,151928.21"
    );
  });
});
```

Now the HTML reporter:

```js
...
class SalaryReporterHTMLReporter extends SalaryReporter {
  write(outPath) {
    const date = new Date();
    const headerRow =
      "<tr>" +
      this.parsedData[0].map((heading) => `<th>${heading}</th>`).join("") +
      "</tr>";
    const dataRows = this.parsedData
      .slice(1)
      .map((row) => {
        const cells = row.map((data) => `<td>${data}</td>`).join("");
        return `<tr>${cells}</tr>`;
      })
      .join("");

    const html = `<html>
    <head>
      <title>Employee Report: ${date}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <table>
        <thead>
          ${headerRow}
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          ${dataRows}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </body>
  </html>`;
    fs.writeFileSync(outPath, html, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  }
}
```

Here's its test:

```js
...
const jsdom = require("jsdom");
const { JSDOM } = jsdom;

describe("SalaryHTMLReporter", () => {
  const outPath = `${__dirname}/employees.html`;
  const safeDelete = () => {
    if (fs.existsSync(outPath)) {
      fs.unlinkSync(outPath);
    }
  };
  beforeEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    safeDelete();
  });
  it("writes an HTML report", () => {
    const htmlReporter = new SalaryReporterHTMLReporter(
      `${__dirname}/employees.json`
    );
    htmlReporter.write(outPath);
    const html = fs.readFileSync(outPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
    const doc = new JSDOM(html).window.document;
    const headers = Array.from(doc.querySelectorAll("table thead th"));
    const dataCells = Array.from(doc.querySelectorAll("table tbody td"));
    expect(headers.length).toEqual(3);
    expect(headers.map((header) => header.textContent)).toEqual([
      "Last Name",
      "First Name",
      "Total",
    ]);

    expect(dataCells.map((cell) => cell.textContent)).toEqual([
      "Doe",
      "John",
      "97234.76",
      "Jane",
      "Mary",
      "151928.21",
    ]);
  });
});
```

Let's code review this implementation:

* The `write` methods perform side effects, namely reading and writing data from the file-system. They are *impure*, meaning the outputs of the `write` methods don't depend soley on their path inputs:
  * What if the file at inPath` doesn't exist?
  * What if the file at `inPath` doesn't have read permissions?
  * What if the caller doesn't have write permissions for `outPath`?
  * In general, the solution is monolihic and mixes concerns between data and how the data is output.
  * To test the class, we have to read an input file, we have to read an output file, and we have to be sure to remove the output file before and after each test-run.
  * What if the content of `inPath` is changed by a person or process? Can we run concurrent tests?
* It's verbose and reads like a step-by-step recipe of how to get from the input to the output. Generally the more verbose code is the more likely we've introduced buts, and it's easy to "get lost in the trees."
* It mutates variables including `employeeTotal` and `this.parsedData` in the base class' `parse` method. Not only is this unnecessary, it makes it harder to reason about, and it's bug-bait.
